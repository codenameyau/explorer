# Youtube Explorer

I built this app because I wanted to rediscover older youtube viral videos.
This app provides my daily source of inspiration, knowledge, and laughter.

The application is fully responsive and has the following features
that were implemented from scratch: instant search, infinite scroll,
history state, date manipulation, and video embedding.

Tech stack: Node, Express, Nunjucks, jQuery, and CSS.

## Development Setup

You will need to obtain a Youtube API key and set this environment variable.

```bash
export YOUTUBE_EXPLORER_API='YOUR API KEY'
```

Then setup and run the application:

```
npm install
nodemon app.js
```
